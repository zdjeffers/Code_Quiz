When I load the page, I want there to be a a text field stating the purpose of the quiz
I want there to be a button under the text field that starts the quiz
I want there to be a timer in the upper right corner
I want there to be a button in the upper left corner that lists the high scores

When I click the high scores button, I want to be able to see the log of everyone who has played using local storage
