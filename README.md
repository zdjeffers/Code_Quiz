# Code_Quiz
A simple quiz utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Get as many point as you can as you race the clock!


### Introduction:
In this repo, the goal was to create a functioning quiz game utilizing JavaScript and JQuery elements. When you start the game, you race against the clock to answer the questions. Every time you get a question wrong, you lose 10 seconds. Once you finish, you log your results into local storage, and see how well you did!

### Here is the final product:
